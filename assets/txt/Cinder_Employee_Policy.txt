CINDER ROBOTICS & MANUFACTURING
COMPANY POLICY DOCUMENT
Effective Date: July 1, 2025
1. Employment Basics
Cinder Robotics & Manufacturing is committed to upholding the principles of equal opportunity employment. We recruit, hire, promote, and compensate employees based on clear, objective performance criteria and qualifications. 
Merit is defined by demonstrated technical proficiency, problem-solving ability, reliability, and adherence to safety protocols. Qualifications are assessed through educational background, relevant certifications, prior experience in robotics or manufacturing, and successful completion of skills assessments. 
Performance criteria for advancement include meeting or exceeding project milestones, contributing to team objectives, and displaying leadership in innovation and workplace safety. The company maintains a merit system consistent with the standards outlined in Allegheny County’s personnel regulations, ensuring that promotions and compensation adjustments are based on meritorious service, seniority, and recommendations from supervisors.
Employment at Cinder is generally governed by Pennsylvania’s at-will employment doctrine. This means that, unless otherwise specified in a written contract, either the employee or the company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, without prior notice. However, this right is subject to important legal limitations: Cinder will never terminate employment for reasons that violate public policy or statutory protections, such as discrimination based on race, gender, age, religion, disability, or national origin, or in retaliation for an employee exercising protected rights (such as filing a workers’ compensation claim or reporting safety violations). All terminations are documented and reviewed to ensure compliance with both federal and Pennsylvania state law, including the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act and the Workers’ Compensation Act.

2. Employee Code of Conduct
Cinder expects all employees to maintain the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical behavior. Employees are required to treat coworkers, clients, and partners with respect and courtesy, fostering a collaborative and inclusive work environment. 
Safety is paramount: employees must strictly adhere to all safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment, machine guarding, and lockout/tagout procedures. Regular participation in safety drills and reporting of unsafe conditions are mandatory. 
Ethical conduct extends to the development and deployment of robotics technologies; employees must ensure that all products meet industry safety standards, avoid introducing bias in automated systems, and provide transparent communication to clients regarding system capabilities and limitations. 
Confidentiality and protection of intellectual property are essential; employees must not disclose proprietary information or trade secrets and are required to sign non-disclosure agreements for sensitive projects.

3. Employee Compensation and Development
Cinder offers competitive compensation packages that reflect the skills and contributions of each employee. Base salaries are benchmarked to exceed the median for robotics and manufacturing roles in Pittsburgh, ensuring we attract and retain top talent.
In addition to base pay, employees are eligible for annual performance-based bonuses, profit-sharing, and patent incentive awards for significant innovations. Cinder also offers stock option plans, allowing employees to acquire equity in the company. These options are structured to vest over a defined period, rewarding long-term commitment and aligning employee interests with the company’s growth. Employees may have opportunities to participate in stock buyback or liquidity events, similar to practices at leading Pittsburgh robotics firms. 
Professional development is integral to our culture; employees receive regular performance reviews, individualized development plans, and access to internal and external training programs. Partnerships with local institutions, such as the ARM Institute and Carnegie Mellon University, provide pathways for upskilling in robotics, circuit design, and advanced manufacturing.

4. Employee Benefits and Perks
Cinder’s benefits package is designed to support the well-being and professional growth of our employees. We provide comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance, as well as disability and life insurance at no cost to employees. 
A 401(k) retirement plan with employer matching is available, with immediate vesting after 30 days of employment. 
Employees enjoy flexible work schedules, wellness initiatives, paid parental leave for six months, and $2,000 for professional development annually. Unique to our industry, Cinder supports employees in obtaining recognized robot safety certifications. These include ISO 10218-1 and ISO 10218-2 certification for industrial robot safety, ANSI/RIA R15.06 certification for robot system integrators, and the new ANSI/A3 R15.08-2 certification for industrial mobile robot systems, which addresses safe integration and operation of mobile robots in industrial environments. 
Certification programs are offered through accredited providers in Pittsburgh and are fully subsidized by the company, with on-site workshops and exam preparation sessions.

5. Working Hours, PTO, and Vacation
Cinder maintains a standard 40-hour workweek, with flexible scheduling options to accommodate project demands and work-life balance. Overtime is compensated at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate for hours worked beyond 40 per week, in accordance with Pennsylvania law. 
Employees accrue a minimum of 20 days of paid time off (PTO) annually, which includes vacation, personal, and sick days, with additional PTO granted for long-term service. Unused PTO may be rolled over up to a specified limit. In cases of employee misconduct, such as theft, harassment, or violation of company policy, Cinder follows a structured process: allegations are thoroughly investigated, the employee is given an opportunity to respond, and disciplinary action—up to and including termination—is taken if warranted. 
All actions are documented to ensure fairness and compliance with legal requirements. In cases of gross misconduct, immediate termination may occur, but only after a fair and impartial review. Severance pay, if applicable, is determined by company policy and the circumstances of separation.

6. Employee Resignation and Termination
Employees may resign at any time, preferably with at least two weeks’ written notice to facilitate a smooth transition. Upon resignation or termination, an exit interview is conducted to gather feedback and ensure the transfer of knowledge and responsibilities. 
Termination decisions, whether for performance or misconduct, are made in accordance with Pennsylvania’s at-will employment law, subject to exceptions for unlawful discrimination, retaliation, or breach of contract. All terminations are documented, and employees receive their final paycheck promptly, in compliance with state law. 
Severance pay may be provided based on years of service and the circumstances of departure.

7. Anti-Discriminatory Statement
Cinder is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment. We strictly prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. In compliance with the CROWN Act, discrimination based on natural hairstyles or hair textures is expressly forbidden. Employees are required to participate in regular bias and diversity training, and any concerns regarding discrimination or harassment can be reported through an anonymous hotline, with all reports investigated promptly and confidentially.

8. Accessibility
Cinder ensures full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Pennsylvania accessibility regulations. Our facilities are designed to be accessible to all employees, with adjustable workstations, accessible restrooms, and Braille signage where appropriate. Digital resources and internal platforms meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility, ensuring that all employees can access necessary information and tools. Reasonable accommodations are provided for employees with disabilities, and regular training is offered to promote disability etiquette and awareness. Feedback from employees is actively sought to continuously improve accessibility and inclusion.
Policy Review and Updates
This policy document is reviewed annually or as needed to reflect changes in laws, regulations, or company operations. Employees are notified of any updates and are required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the revised policies.
